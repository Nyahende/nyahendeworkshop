    <h1 class="productheading" style="color:orangered">Types Of Chicken </h1>
        <p class="typespara" style="padding:10px;color:white">There are several different breeds of Chicken,some of them are specific for laying eggs
            ,some of them for meat only and some of them for both.Therefore choosing a specific type of chicken to 
            keep should consider your output expectation. In this site we have listed and expalined
            some of the most common types of chicken especially those who can be raised in Africa.We have expalined
            their origin, their behaviour and their main purpose.

            <li class="typesli"  style="padding:10px;color:orangered">African Local Chicken.
                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">There has been a research gap in the genetic, physiological,
                     and nutritional aspects of indigenous chickens of Africa over the past decade.
                     These chickens are known to be economically, socially, and culturally important
                     to the people of Africa, especially those from marginalised communities.
                     Although they are associated with poor productivity in terms of the number of
                     eggs laid, most consumers prefer their flavoursome meat. Several local chickens 
                     have been classified into breeds or ecotypes, but many remain unidentified and 
                     are facing extinction.It is believed that the local chickens of Africa originated 
                     from South-East Asia, China, and India . Local chickens are hardy and can
                     adapt to local conditions better than other breeds because of their ability to 
                     withstand harsh climatic conditions due to their typical genetic development .
                     Further to this, they also possess a strong ability to anticipate danger and act quickly.
                     Alders and Spradbrow  stated that local chickens have a strong ability to fly and run 
                     to escape dangers and predators in comparison with commercial chickens. These traits make 
                     them strong enough to survive and produce in an unfavourable environment.
                    Local African Chicken are considered to be fully matured and start to lay eggs when they are 
                around 18-24 weeks old.</p>

            <li class="typesli"  style="padding:10px;color:orangered">Broiler Chicken.
                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">A broiler is any chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) that is bred
                     and raised specifically for meat production. Most commercial broilers reach 
                     slaughter weight between four and seven weeks of age, although slower growing 
                     breeds reach slaughter weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. Typical broilers 
                     have white feathers and yellowish skin. Broiler or sometimes broiler-fryer is also
                      used sometimes to refer specifically to younger chickens under 2.0 kilograms
                       (4+1⁄2 lb), as compared with the larger roasters.
                      Due to extensive breeding selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry 
                      used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, 
                      particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions and 
                      congestive heart conditions. Management of ventilation, housing, stocking density
                    and in-house procedures must be evaluated regularly to support good welfare of the
                    flock. The breeding stock (broiler-breeders) do grow to maturity but also have their 
                    own welfare concerns related to the frustration of a high feeding motivation and beak
                     trimming. Broilers are usually grown as mixed-sex flocks in large sheds under 
                     intensive conditions. </p>

            <li class="typesli"  style="padding:10px;color:orangered">Kuroiler Chicken.
                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">Introduced in the early 1990s, the breed was created by Vinod
                     Kapur of Kegg Farms Private, ltd., and the name is a portmanteau of Kegg and 
                     Broiler(KUROILER). Rather than all being raised in a central hatchery.The Kuroiler 
                     is a hybrid breed of chicken developed by the Keggfarms Group in Gurgaon, Haryana.
                     Kuroilers are derived from crossing either coloured broiler males with Rhode Island
                     Red females, or, White Leghorn males crossed with female Rhode Island Reds.Kuroilers, 
                     a dual-purpose breed producing meat and eggs, can live on a diet of kitchen and
                     agricultural waste, and produce around 150 eggs per year whereas native Indian hens 
                     lay only 40 per year. The meat yield per bird of Kuroilers is also greater; males weigh
                     approximately 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) and females about 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) whereas the native male 
                     bird weighs 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) and females 1.2 kg (2.6 lb). Due to its unique genetic
                     features, the Kuroiler is resistant to diseases. The kuroiler chick is a potential 
                     bio-converter of no cost agricultural, household and natural waste abundant in 
                     villages — into human protein food and substantial incomes for rural households.Kuroiler 
                     mature in about 10 weeks compared to local breeds that take several months or even up
                     to a year to mature.  </p>

                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">In the 1950s Serge Perrault from southern France wanted to preserve
                     the traditional chicken breeds.  His work led to the development of the Sasso T lines.
                     A project by a cooperative of farmers in the same area led to the creation of SASSO 
                     when they were involved in the development of the “Label Rouge” specifications for 
                     traditional chicken. It was in the 1990s that SASSO opened a second location near the airport
                      so as to streamline the export
                    of the SASSO breeds.Sasso chicken is a duo purpose breed which can be used for meat and eggs. ...
                     Sasso delivers profit to farmers and a great taste to consumers. Sasso can lay up to 240 
                     eggs per year yet they can attain between 2.5-3 kilogrammes live weight within 12 weeks 
                     (three months).Sasso start laying eggs from 5 months .

                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">Layer poultry farming means raising egg laying poultry birds for the purpose 
                    of commercial egg production. Layer chickens are such a special species of hens, which need 
                    to be raised from when they are one day old. They start laying eggs commercially from 18-19 
                    weeks of age. They remain laying eggs continuously till their 72-78 weeks of age. They can 
                    produce about one kg of eggs by consuming about 2.25 kg of food during their egg laying 
                    period. For the purpose of producing hybrid eggs layer, consider the various characteristics
                    of cock and hen before breeding. There are various types of highly egg productive layer
                     breeds available throughout the world,whic include White Egg Laying Hens and Brown Egg Laying Hens

                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">The New Hampshire breed of chicken originated in the state of New 
                    Hampshire in the United States. Poultry farmers, starting with Rhode Island Reds 
                    and performing generation after generation of selective breeding, intensified the
                    characteristics of early maturity, rapid full feathering, and production of large
                    brown eggs. The mature birds are a rich chestnut red, of a somewhat lighter and 
                    more even shade than the Rhode Island Reds. The chicks are also a lighter red.They
                    possess
                    a deep, broad body, grow feathers very rapidly, are prone to go broody and make
                    good mothers. Most pin feathers are a reddish, brownish buff in color and, therefore
                    , do not detract from the carcass appearance very much. The color is a medium to
                    light red and often fades in the sunshine. The comb is single and medium to large
                    in size; in the females it often lops over a bit. While mainly raised for meat,
                    they are also modest producers of brown eggs. Some strains lay eggs of a dark 
                    brown shell color. They are available in both standard and bantam varieties.
                    Generally a docile breed. They were initially used in the Chicken of Tomorrow 
                    contests, which led the way for the modern broiler industry, and they were 
                    used to develop the Delaware breed of chicken. A hen of this breed will lay
                    about 240 large brown eggs a year. A full grown hen typically weighs 6.5 pounds 
                    (2.9 kg), while a full-grown rooster weighs approximately 8.5 pounds (3.9 kg).
                    Pullets weigh around 5.5 pounds (2.5 kg), and cockerels will weigh about 7.5
                    pounds (3.4 kg). They are currently on watch status according to the American 
                    Livestock Breeds Conservancy (ALBC). Their preferred roost height is 2 to 4 feet 
                    (0.61 to 1.22 m).

It is a dual-purpose chicken, selected more for meat production than egg production. Medium heavy in weight, 
it dresses plump carcass used as either a broiler or a roaster.

                <p class="typespara"  style="padding:10px;color:white">The Malay is a breed of game chicken. It is among the tallest breeds of
                     chicken, and may stand over 90 cm (36 inches) high.[5] The Malay is bred principally in 
                     Europe,[3] and in Australia and the United States.[6] It was derived, partly in Devon and Cornwall in 
                     south-west England,[7] from birds imported from Indian subcontinent[5] or South-east Asia in
                      the first decades of the nineteenth century, when large birds of this type were widespread in 
                      northern India, in Indonesia and in the Malay Peninsula.[8]

                    The Malay was the first chicken breed to be bantamised; a dwarf version of the standard-sized 
                    breed was created
                   at the turn of the twentieth century.[1]
